Only 2015 I decided to continue watching and got addicted like it seemed complicated at first, too many stories and characters. I even used a guide from internet like family tree per house while watching or GOT wiki so I can have more background on the characters. For a TV series, this show can really take you to a different world and never knowing what will happen. It is very daring that any time anybody can just die (I learned not to be attached and have accepted that they will all die so I won't be devastated hehe). I have never read the books but the show is entertaining and you will really root for your faves and really hate on those you hate. \\r\\n\\r\\nFantasy, action, drama, comedy, love...and lots of surprises!",

The camera angles, the score, the pacing mesh together for grand storytelling: a mix of horror, swords and sorcery, and endless treachery. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd all of that would be somewhat squandered if it wasn't for the best casting I've ever seen. From Lena Headey as soft spoken Cersei to Peter Vaughan as ancient Maester Aemon, each character pulses with depth and believability. Peter Dinklage may have sacrificed a virgin princess to get this role; I've never seen a better fit, not in size (though there is that) but in the way his eyes convey shrewd arrogance coupled with unabashed debauchery.",

And adds a twinkle of big budget movies, and great cinematography. Truly awesome. Up until this point, I was in love with the series, a 10/10. I quickly read all the books, and re-watched all seasons before a new one would come out.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, from season 5 and onwards, it starts going downhill. They ran out of book-material, and it shows. Everything starts focusing on the big set-pieces, characters become extremely bland and predictable. From here all major characters receive plot-armor, which was one of the things it didn't have before, and that made it interesting to watch. Of course they want you to think that they will still kill some of the main characters, but they're just teasing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last few seasons I've only been watching to see what the conclusion to this story is, but I cringe and writhe during every episode I watch. What a pitiful way to go out. Hopefully the books finish the story in a more interesting and believable way.",

I'm big fan of Vikings TV series and when I asked opinion about GOT to my friend, he said Vikings is nothing compared to GOT. All my coworkers are GOT addicts, so finally I gave it a try. I watched all 8 seasons, so I'm quite qualified to review it: It wasn't bad TV show. Actually it was quite good with interesting characters, but it wasn't as good as I was told and I personally don't agree on that statement that it's better than Vikings. Most interesting parts where around queen Daenerys. This TV show gets tense after season 7, however things don't go like we wanted and ending is awfully bad. Basically, this TV show is ruined by stupidly bad ending which leaves you quite upset. In short, GOT is good TV show (not great), ruined by bad ending.",
